Plan: Three‑Phase Calendar Scheduling App (Final Revision)
MVP focus: Three independent repos (brb-baristas, brb-events, brb-website) with shared Firebase backend. Bands self-register via email/password on invite link, manage only their events. Admin dashboard manages all events/bands. Each repo deploys independently to AWS containers via GitHub Actions. Firebase free tier only.

Phase 1: Dev Local Setup & Firebase/Google Calendar Integration
Step 1.1: Firebase Project Setup (Shared Backend)

Create single Firebase project (DEV environment) at console.firebase.google.com
Enable Firestore (us-central1 region, test mode)
Enable Firebase Auth (email/password provider)
Download service account key for backend Google Calendar API
Create .env.local with Firebase config for local dev
Step 1.2: Firestore Schema Design (All 3 Repos Share)

collections/events: { id, title, date, startTime, endTime, description, bandEmail, adminId, bandId, googleCalendarEventId, status (pending/confirmed/cancelled) }
collections/bands: { id, email, passwordHash, bandName, bio, status (active/inactive), createdAt, createdBy (adminId) }
collections/invitations: { id, email, token (single-use), createdAt, expiresAt (5min after creation), claimed }
Step 1.3: brb-baristas Repo Setup (Admin Dashboard)

Initialize React + Vite project
Install: firebase, react-router-dom, axios, date-fns
Structure: /src/pages/Dashboard.jsx, /src/pages/BandManagement.jsx, /src/pages/EventManagement.jsx
Create /src/firebase/config.js with Firebase initialization
Admin login: Firebase Auth (email/password, hardcoded admin account or admin flag in Firestore)
Features:
View all events + all bands
Create/edit/delete events → sync to Google Calendar
Generate invitation: create token, set expiry (5 min), send email or display link to copy
View band event requests
Approve/confirm band bookings → update Google Calendar
Step 1.4: brb-events Repo Setup (Band Portal)

Initialize React + Vite project (separate from brb-baristas)
Install same dependencies
Structure: /src/pages/SignUp.jsx, /src/pages/Login.jsx, /src/pages/ClaimInvite.jsx, /src/pages/MyEvents.jsx, /src/pages/EventDetail.jsx
Band signup: email + password (Firebase Auth), claim invitation token (verify token valid + not expired)
Band login: email/password → Firebase Auth
Features:
Claim invitation token → links band to event
View only their own events
Create new event (if permitted by admin via token)
Edit their own event details
Delete their own event
View confirmation status in Google Calendar
Step 1.5: brb-website Repo Setup (Public Website)

Initialize React + Vite project (separate)
Display public events (read-only from Firestore)
Contact/info page
Link to band signup (brb-events invitation link)
Step 1.6: Google Calendar OAuth Integration (Admin Only)

Register OAuth app in Google Cloud Console
OAuth redirect: http://localhost:5173/oauth-callback (for local dev; update for prod)
brb-baristas: implement OAuth flow to authorize admin account
Store OAuth token securely in Firestore (admin doc only)
Google Calendar API: create, update, delete events from admin actions
Step 1.7: Band Self-Registration Flow

Admin generates invitation link: events.brbcoffee-atx.com/claim?token=<TOKEN>
Band clicks link → lands on signup form (email + password)
Band signs up → Firebase Auth creates account
System validates token (exists, not expired, not claimed) → claims token for band
Band linked to event in Firestore, can now view/edit/delete that event only
Step 1.8: Admin Event Management

Login as admin
Create event: title, date, time, description → save to Firestore + Google Calendar
Edit event: modify details, sync to Google Calendar
Delete event: remove from Firestore + Google Calendar
Generate invitation: new token (UUID), set 5-min expiry, display "copy link" or send email
Step 1.9: Band Event Management

Login as band (email/password)
View events they're invited to/created
Create new event (if admin allows) or claim existing one
Edit event: update details, sync to Google Calendar (via admin service account)
Delete event: remove from Firestore + Google Calendar
Each band sees only their own events, no access to other bands
Step 1.10: Local Development Setup

Clone 3 repos into workspace: brb-baristas, brb-events, brb-website
Each repo has dev or docker-compose.local.yml to run independently
Shared .env.local template for Firebase config (copy to each repo)
Run individually: npm run dev in each folder (dev server on different ports: 3001, 3002, 3000)
Or run all via single Docker Compose: orchestrate all 3 services


we start locally by installing depencies
